WPF Project

Fix Layout and colors
Throw exceptions
Add buttons to change all the files (maybe a selectable option to select individual files)


ConfigStringManager:

It doesn't use XDocument because everytime we save a file it "normalizes" it removing "insignificant whitespaces", generating more changes to the config files than desired, so the solution was to work with plain text and regex expressions.

KNOWN ISSUES:
	
	If the file changes while the ConfigStringManager is open, it doesn't update the files. Add a RELOAD button to update the files content.
	Async issue, when selecting a connection string it takes time to load, sometimes you have to select a different connection string and then come back (usually the second selection works). Fix it.
		
IMPROVEMENTS TO DO:

	REPLACE dbBommain DATABASE STRING ACROSS ALL FILES
	Allow user to update database value across a file/environment (similar to what is being done for updating server value for a whole environment/file. e.g.: Update all databases named "dbbommain")
	
FEATURES AVAILABLE:

	- Manage config files in multiple environments (BOMi environment)
	- Updates database(s) and server(s) value(s) in config files
		- At environment level (update all servers for a whole environment)
		- At file level (update all servers for a whole file)
		- At connection string level (specific connection strings. e.g.: Update dbSecurity connection string in PubSub web.config file)
