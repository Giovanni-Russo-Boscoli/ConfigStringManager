WPF Project

ConfigStringManager:

	NOTE: It doesn't use XDocument to manage config files because everytime we save a file it "normalizes" it removing "insignificant whitespaces", generating more changes to the config files than desired, 
so the solution was to work with plain text and regex expressions.

KNOWN ISSUES:
	
	databases not being loaded sometimes.

	THROW AN EXCEPTION/MESSAGE IF THE SERVER WASN'T FOUND/ ABLE TO ACCESS
		
IMPROVEMENTS TO DO:

	Make it responsive (adapts to screen size and resizing action)
	REPLACE dbBommain DATABASE STRING ACROSS ALL FILES
	Allow user to update database value across a file/environment (similar to what is being done for updating server value for a whole environment/file. e.g.: Update all databases named "dbbommain")
	
FEATURES AVAILABLE:

	- Manage config files in multiple environments (BOMi environment)
	- Updates database(s) and server(s) value(s) in config files
		- At environment level (update all servers for a whole environment)
		- At file level (update all servers for a whole file)
		- At connection string level (specific connection strings. e.g.: Update dbSecurity connection string in PubSub web.config file)
